- This repository contains code for the experiments in the ICLR 2019 workshop paper titled ``GAN-based generation and automatic selection of explanations for neural networks''.

- Additionally, the repository also contains the code for more experiments that have been reported in Chapter 5 of my thesis titled `` interpretable machine learning for machine listening''

- A more detailed readme would be added soon.
